Running legacy mod_perl with Plack
==================================

Using mod_perl had some benefits over plain CGI.pm. You got some sort of
persistence and a tight integration with Apache. Unfortunately you got a tight
integration with Apache. This makes mod_perl have some obscure quirks and can
make mod_perl applications hard to test and debug.

Today Plack/PSGI provides a nice layer between the web server and your code.
This is great for new projects, but what about old legacy code tightly
integrated with mod_perl's request object?

On way would be to fake the request object on top of Plack. This provides the
ability to run your mod_perl application with any Plack capable webserver
togeter with generic Plack::Middleware layers.
